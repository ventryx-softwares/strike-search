# Pinned. Upstream used :latest, which rebuilds daily. A redeploy months from
# now -- triggered by an unrelated config change, or by Railway recreating the
# service -- would then quietly ship a different SearXNG than the one that was
# tested. Bump this line on purpose, and re-test when you do.

# Each uwsgi worker is a separate Python process with its own copy of
# SearXNG's loaded engine modules -- on the Railway free trial's RAM budget,
# 4 workers means 4x the memory for an instance that only ever serves one
# person at a time. Down from 4 to 2: still enough to handle one request
# while another is in flight, without the duplicated memory pushing the
# container toward its limit (which shows up as generalized slowness, not
# a clean out-of-memory error). Override via SEARXNG_UWSGI_WORKERS if this
# instance ever needs to handle real concurrent traffic.

# Copied twice on purpose. The Railway service mounts a volume at
# /etc/searxng, and a volume mount hides whatever the image put at that path.
# The -backup copy is outside the mount, so entrypoint.sh can always reach the
# config the image was built with and sync it in.

# Strike's branding: templates, logo, and a CSS file that overrides the
# colour variables SearXNG's own stylesheet defines, loaded after it so these
# values win without patching the minified file directly. Baked into the
# image here rather than left as a live edit in the running container, so a
# redeploy doesn't quietly revert to stock SearXNG branding. See overlay/.
